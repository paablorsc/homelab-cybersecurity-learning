Hands-on cybersecurity and virtualization learning using Proxmox and virtual machines, focusing on ethical labs, user behavior, and human-centric security concepts.

# Cybersecurity & Virtualization Learning Labs

This repository documents my hands-on learning in cybersecurity and virtualization.
The goal is to understand how systems are built, how users make mistakes, and how attacks
like phishing work from a defensive and awareness perspective.

## Environment
- Proxmox VE (homelab)
- Virtual machines: Linux, Windows, Kali Linux
- Isolated lab environment (no real users or live systems)

## What I worked on

### Proxmox & Virtualization
- Installed and configured Proxmox
- Created and managed virtual machines
- Used snapshots and backups
- Practiced VM isolation and basic networking

### Virtual Machines
- Linux VM for server and system practice
- Windows VM to understand user-side behavior
- Kali Linux VM for security learning (lab use only)

### Cybersecurity Learning
- Basic understanding of phishing techniques (awareness-focused)
- How social engineering attacks target user behavior
- Introductory use of Kali Linux tools for learning purposes
- Following ethical and legal boundaries

## What I learned
- How attackers think vs how users behave
- Importance of human-focused security
- How virtualization helps create safe learning environments
- Why user awareness is critical in cybersecurity

## Notes
This repository is for educational purposes only.
No real attacks, credentials, or live infrastructure are used.**
